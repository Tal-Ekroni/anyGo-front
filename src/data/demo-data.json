The restroom was really nice and seemed like it had just been renovated or kept very clean. The living room sofa is extremely uncomfortable BUT there is an air mattress to make up for that. I highly recommend sleeping on the air mattress NOT SOFA if you have a larger party that needs 3 beds. Both bedrooms were great, clean and spacious. ",
